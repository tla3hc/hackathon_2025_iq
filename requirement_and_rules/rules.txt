What:
Build the fastest, smartest route & energy optimization algorithm. Compete under pressure to prove your fleet is the smartest.

#############################################################################################################################

Rule:
"1. Initial Deployment
- Start with 2 delivery trucks at the hub with a unique ID. 
- Each trucks can pick up max 3 packages 

2. Delivery Requests
- 40 packages will generated randomly.
- Each includes pickup & drop-off locations and a monetary value.

3. Strategic Assignment
- Choose which packages to accept.
- Assign to one of your trucks.

4. Optimization & Execution
- The team calculates optimal routes based on distance.
- Routes are sent to the server for execution.

5. Live Monitoring
- View real-time truck locations, statuses (idle, en route, delivering), remaining time, and delivery progress.

6. Scoring System
- Deliver the most packages as you can
- Earn money for each successful delivery.
- Winner: Most packages successfully delivered.
- Tie-breaker: Team with the highest total revenue.

Detail:
A reference source code will be provided with basic functionalities.
Each team have 1 day to develops follow the requirement and starter kit provide organizer.
Test your code on local Server from stater kit

1. Starter Kit & Reference Code
Each team will receive a starter kit containing:
- Basic functionalities implemented in the reference source code and localization server for you to try algorithm
- Documentation and API details for integration.
- Teams must build upon this foundation to implement the required features.

2. Development Time
- You have 1 day (24 hours) to complete your solution.
- All development must be done within the allocated time frame.

3. Testing
 - Try algorithm on localization server on your PC

4. Competition


#############################################################################################################################

Procedure:
"HACKING:
S1: Get reference source code and localization server from starter kit.
S2: Read, understand the code and the develop required functionalities.
S3: Develop your route
S3.1 Get information from server by calling provided API(pickup & drop-off locations and a monetary value, your start positions)
S3.2: 
- Making Decision: Choose the most efficency delivery mission for 2 trucks (AI might be applied)
- Shortest Route: Base on the chosen missions, find the most optimized route to delivery as many as posible packaged in 3 mins 
     => submit the route to Sever by calling provided API to perform the Delivery
S4: Running your code on localization server 
S5. Fix/optimize your code
S6. back to S3

COMPETITION:
S1: Try connect competition server.
S2: Register, wait for your turn
S3: Wait to the starting signal from organization 
S4: 
- Earn money for each successful delivery.
- Winner: Team with the highest total revenue.
- Tie-breaker: Most packages successfully delivered"
